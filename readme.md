# Kevin Portfolio
Woah!!!! So good to be back it's been about two months since I last used css, na UI wan kill me.
So I just decided to attempt this today and I was actually quite suprised by how much css I could remember, did I also mention that I was shocked by how many bugs I managed to conjure up LMAO!!!

This project was Inspired by a youtube video I came across some months ago, I didn't follow the style guide in the video, I just took screenshots and vibed with it.
